## Determining Reference Spectra
1. Combine channels for images of cells expressing a single chromophore: 'combine channels.ipynb'
2. Draw regions of interest: 'multicolor roi drawing.ipynb'
3. Calculate average reference spectra: 'calculate reference spectra w masks.ipynb'

## Unmixing multi-chromophore images
1. Unmix
